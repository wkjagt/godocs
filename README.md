The docs on golang.org are nice, but the formatting makes it hard to read (maybe it's a metter of taste though). I copied the contents of a document I wanted to read (https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) to a markdown file to make it easier to read.

I haven't done all the formatting (yet?), but most elements thar have a real impact on readability (headers, code blocks) are there. I started putting the ticks around keywords in sentences, but that was just too much work. I may do it one day if I'm really bored ;-)
